Vatican Replaces Doves With Balloons As Symbol Of Peace

The Vatican traditionally releases a pair of doves on the last Sunday of January to symbolize peace, but after last year’s event, in which the doves were immediately attacked by a seagull and a black crow, the Vatican decided this year to release colorful balloons instead. What do you think?

#mc vatican
#mc dove
#ac catholics
#ac non-catholics
#mc balloons
#ac balloon professionals
#ac dove raisers
#ac pidgeons

#win doves - no more dove hunters
#lose doves - loss of pretige
#win PETA - less animal cruelty
#lose doves - mad they are no longer the peace symbol

#conflict doves vs. balloons (dove's lawyers)
#assumption this is good
#assumption doing it for the stated reason

#assoc catholic -> turn the other cheek when attacked

why did the pidgeons get attacked by seagulls
""they started it.""

Maybe the vatican should keep their balloon and just feed the seagulls more.

Why a balloon?
Pretty.
Won't get attacked.
visible for miles

What else could be a symbol of peace?
olive branch
handshake


what could go wrong?


Noah released doves to check for land after the flood.
